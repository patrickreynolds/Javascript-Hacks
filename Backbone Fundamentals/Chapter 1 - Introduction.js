// Introduction to Backbone

/*
What does a js framework do?
Client applicaitons pull raw data from the server and render it into
the browser when and where it is needed.

What is a use case for syncing up client and server side data?
Take the one page shopping cart example. As ajax requests are
getting called with jQuery, this introduces implicit model 
data on the client side.

Introduction:
"You can't make an architect. You can however open the doors and windows 
toward the light as you see it." - Frank Lloyd Wright

Backbone solves this problem for you, providing a way to cleanly organize 
code, separating responsibilities into recognizable pieces that are easy to maintain.

/*
What is MVC?

MVC - Model View Controller

Models:
Models represent the domin-specific knowledge and data in an application. This 
of this as being a 'type' of data you can model.
Examples: User, Photo, or Todo note. Models can notify observers when their state changes.

Views:
Views typically constitute the user interface in an applicaiton (eg. markup and templates), 
but don't have to be. They observe Models, but don't directly communicate with them.

Controllers:
Controllers handle input (e.g. clicks, user actions) and update Models

In summary, user input is acted upon by Controller which update Models. Views 
observe Models and update the user interface when changes occur.

/*
What is Backbone.js?
Backbone.js is a lightweight JavaScript library that adds structure to your client-side 
code. It makes it easy to manage and decouple concerns in your application, leaving you 
with code that is more maintainable in the long term.

Backbone is commonly used for Single Page Applications (SPAs). SPAs are web applications
that load into the browser and then react to data changes on the client side without 
requiring comple page refreshes from the server

*/

/*
When Do I Need A JavaScropt MVC Framework?
Common use cases for using a javascript framework is to accommodate a complex user interface 
or simple trying to reduce the nubmer of HTTP requests required for new Views
	
*/

/*
Why Consider Backbone.js?

Backbone provides a minimal set of data-structuring (Models, Collections) and user interface 
(Views, URLs) primitives that are helpful when building dymamic applications using JavaScript.
